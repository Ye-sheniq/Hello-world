# Hello-world

Hello there!
I am now thinking hard to find something to say...
Well, the only thing that I have found is that I'm not very good at talking and I just don't know whether ot is a bad thing or not.
The embarrassing 30 seconds of scilence after fist meeting someone is probably not very enjoyable.
But what can I say?
